# Eule.py

A Diablo III Macro Collection.\
Working with all 16:9 Resolutions guaranteed.\
Should work on any Resolution (not tested).

## Macros

All Macros are sent directly to Diablo III without using your physical mouse or keyboard.\
This has numerous advantages, such as

* Faster Macro execution time
* Reliability
* Working without Diablo III beeing in the foreground

## Setting Hotkeys

To set a Hotkey

1. Click the Button next to the Label of the Hotkey you would like to set
2. Press the combination of keys you would like to use
3. Accept the new Combination

You may cancel setting a Hotkey by pressing __Escape__.\
You may delete a Hotkey by clicking and pressing __Delete__.

## Abbrevations

* Replaces Abbrevations with full sentences.
* To use an added Abbrevation, type it in the chat and then tap __space__ once.

I prefer this Version of sending Messages over a simple Hotkey Version due to having to remember less Hotkeys.

## Third Party Launcher

* Launches your Third Party Tools.
* Upon first Startup select the paths to your Tools.
* You will have to reconfigure pHelper at first use.
* Start Eule.py as Admin to not have to accept the Popups.

## Auto Stuff

* Only Auto Start Game works with TurboHUD enabled.
* Automates some of the Macros using Image Recognition.
* Check at the Bottom if it is working for your Resolution.

This Feature is _VERY_ suboptimal right now, as it is using AHK to capture the Screen.\
Thus not beeing able to capture inactive Windows => Not working with TurboHud.\
I am sadly forced to that compromise, due to Python Image Librarys beeing extremely large when compiled (Current exe with good Image Recognition would be 6x the Size).\
If people really want to use all of those Auto Features and dont mind the huge exe size (this means longer start up time, but fast when started), I will release a Version with that.
